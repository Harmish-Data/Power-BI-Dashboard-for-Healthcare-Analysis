# Power BI Dashboard for Healthcare Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze healthcare data. The dashboard provides visual insights into various aspects of healthcare, including patient demographics, treatment costs, recovery ratings, and more. The goal is to help healthcare providers and administrators make data-driven decisions to improve patient care and operational efficiency.

## Key Insights
1. **Average Cost per Patient**: The average cost per patient is $10.04K.
2. **Average Cost per Day**: The average daily cost for treatment is $998.36.
3. **Average Rating for Treatment**: The average rating for treatment is 5.44 out of 10.
4. **Average Age for Treatment**: The average age of patients undergoing treatment is 50.50 years.
5. **Rating vs. Total Bill**: Medicine has the highest rating and consulting has the lowest rating when comparing treatment ratings to total bill amounts.
6. **Admission Trends**: The last quarter saw the lowest number of admissions in the hospital for treatment.
7. **Gender-based Recovery Ratings**: Females have the highest recovery ratings compared to other genders.

## Key Features
1. **Data Import and Transformation**:
   - Imported healthcare datasets from Excel files.
   - Used Power Query to clean and transform data, including deleting unnecessary columns and adding new columns for analysis.

2. **Data Merging**:
   - Merged different datasets to create a unified view of the healthcare data.
   - Performed left joins to combine patient data with hospital data.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Created a dashboard with multiple charts, including line charts, pie charts, donut charts, area charts, and stacked bar charts.
   - Included slicers to filter data by different dimensions such as gender, treatment type, and hospital.

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Added number cards to display key metrics at a glance.
   - Implemented slicers to allow users to interact with the data and filter visualizations dynamically.

5. **Data Analysis**:
   - Conducted analysis to derive meaningful insights from the data.
   - Identified trends and patterns in patient demographics, treatment costs, and recovery ratings.
